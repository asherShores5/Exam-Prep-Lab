Your company deals with a wealth of sensitive information. Your manager would like to reduce the risk of data exfiltration from company systems. What would you recommend?
Enable a host-based firewall.
Patch the systems.
Disable wireless networking.
Correct answer
Disable USB ports.
Overall explanation

Correct answer:

Disable USB ports is correct. One of the techniques to prevent data exfiltration, which is the unauthorized copying of information, is to disable USB ports on the system so that a USB drive cannot be connected to it. Another technique is to use data loss prevention (DLP) solutions, which would block leaking information through USB drives and e-mail.

Question 77Skipped
Rebecca is the systems administrator for a small accounting firm and would like to ensure that wireless guests cannot access the company file servers. Her company has purchased a single router/switch/access point. What should she do to achieve these security goals? (Choose two.)
Disable the file server ports.
Correct selection
Create a VLAN for the file servers.
Set the WPA2 key to a new value.
Deny file server traffic on the WAN port.
Correct selection
Configure an ACL on the router to allow access to the file server VLAN.
Overall explanation

Correct answers:

Create a VLAN for the file servers and configure an ACL on the router to allow access to the file server VLAN are correct. To control communication, Rebecca can place the servers in their own VLAN, which restricts communication by default. She can then create an ACL on the router to allow authorized systems to communicate with the file server VLAN.


Incorrect answers:

Deny file server traffic on the WAN port is incorrect. Disabling file server traffic on the WAN port has nothing to do with the scenario and is incorrect because Rebecca’s goal is to control communication between wireless guests and company file servers (the scenario does not deal with Internet WAN traffic). 


Disable the file server ports is incorrect. She cannot disable the ports the file servers are connected to because that will prevent everyone from being able to communicate with them. 


Set the WPA2 key to a new value is incorrect. Changing the WPA2 key will not help separate wireless guest traffic from the company file servers.
