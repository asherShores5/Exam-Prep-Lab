### A company is streaming its high-volume billing data (100 MBps) to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. A data analyst partitioned the data on account_id to ensure that all records belonging to an account go to the same Kinesis shard and order is maintained. While building a custom consumer using the Kinesis Java SDK, the data analyst notices that, sometimes, the messages arrive out of order for account_id. Upon further investigation, the data analyst discovers the messages that are out of order seem to be arriving from different shards for the same account_id and are seen when a stream resize runs. What is an explanation for this behavior and what is the solution?

- [ ] There are multiple shards in a stream and order needs to be maintained in the shard. The data analyst needs to make sure there is only a single shard in the stream and no stream resize runs.
- [ ] The hash key generation process for the records is not working correctly. The data analyst should generate an explicit hash key on the producer side so the records are directed to the appropriate shard accurately.
- [ ] The records are not being received by Kinesis Data Streams in order. The producer should use the PutRecords API call instead of the PutRecord API call with the SequenceNumberForOrdering parameter.
- [x] The consumer is not processing the parent shard completely before processing the child shards after a stream resize. The data analyst should process the parent shard completely first before processing the child shards.

### A company that monitors weather conditions from remote construction sites is setting up a solution to collect temperature data from the following two weather stations. Station A, which has 10 sensors. Station B, which has five sensors.These weather stations were placed by onsite subject-matter experts. Each sensor has a unique ID. The data collected from each sensor will be collected using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Based on the total incoming and outgoing data throughput, a single Amazon Kinesis data stream with two shards is created. Two partition keys are created based on the station names. During testing, there is a bottleneck on data coming from Station A, but not from StationB. Upon review, it is confirmed that the total stream throughput is still less than the allocated Kinesis Data Streams throughput. How can this bottleneck be resolved without increasing the overall cost and complexity of the solution, while retaining the data collection quality requirements?

- [x] Store the mapping file in an Amazon S3 bucket and configure it as a reference data source for the Kinesis Data Analytics application. Change the SQL query in the application to include a join to the reference table and add the territory code field to the SELECT columns.
- [ ] Store the contents of the mapping file in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Change the Kinesis Data Analytics application to send its output to an AWS Lambda function that fetches the mapping and supplements each record to include the territory code, if one exists. Forward the record from the Lambda function to the original application destination.

### A company has collected more than 100 TB of log files in the last 24 months. The files are stored as raw text in a dedicated Amazon S3 bucket. Each object has a key of the form year-month-day_log_HHmmss.txt where HHmmss represents the time the log file was initially created. A table was created in Amazon Athena that points to the S3 bucket. One-time queries are run against a subset of columns in the table several times an hour. A data analyst must make changes to reduce the cost of running these queries. Management wants a solution with minimal maintenance overhead. Which combination of steps should the data analyst take to meet these requirements? (Choose THREE)

- [ ] Convert the log files to Apace Avro format.
- [x] Add a key prefix of the form date=year-month-day/ to the S3 objects to partition the data.
- [x] Convert the log files to Apache Parquet format.
- [ ] Add a key prefix of the form year-month-day/ to the S3 objects to partition the data.
- [ ] Drop and recreate the table with the PARTITIONED BY clause. Run the ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION statement.
- [x] Drop and recreate the table with the PARTITIONED BY clause. Run the MSCK REPAIR TABLE statement.

### A company has an application that ingests streaming data. The company needs to analyze this stream over a 5-minute timeframe to evaluate the stream for anomalies with Random Cut Forest (RCF) and summarize the current count of status codes. The source and summarized data should be persisted for future use. Which approach would enable the desired outcome while keeping data persistence costs low?

- [ ] Ingest the data stream with Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Have an AWS Lambda consumer evaluate the stream, collect the number status codes, and evaluate the data against a previously trained RCF model. Persist the source and results as a time series to Amazon DynamoDB.
- [x] Ingest the data stream with Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Have a Kinesis Data Analytics application evaluate the stream over a 5-minute window using the RCF function and summarize the count of status codes. Persist the source and results to Amazon S3 through output delivery to Kinesis Data Firehouse.
- [ ] Ingest the data stream with Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with a delivery frequency of 1 minute or 1 MB in Amazon S3. Ensure Amazon S3 triggers an event to invoke an AWS Lambda consumer that evaluates the batch data, collects the number status codes, and evaluates the data against a previously trained RCF model. Persist the source and results as a time series to Amazon DynamoDB.
- [ ] Ingest the data stream with Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with a delivery frequency of 5 minutes or 1 MB into Amazon S3. Have a Kinesis Data Analytics application evaluate the stream over a 1-minute window using the RCF function and summarize the count of status codes. Persist the results to Amazon S3 through a Kinesis Data Analytics output to an AWS Lambda integration.
