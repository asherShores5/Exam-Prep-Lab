File system data integrity would be provided by digital signing or file hashes, but not by encryption. Disk encryption is not possible for SAN disks is incorrect. Hardware disk encryption on a server is often done with TPM, which is a firmware chip storing cryptographic keys. Linux cannot use SAN disks is incorrect. SAN disks appear to the OS as local disks; Linux does support the use of SAN disks."

Enforcing full device encryption on all employee mobile devices is a critical security technique for mobile device management. If someone finds the device and is determined to crack the password, this may slow down the process, but they likely will be able to decrypt the data eventually.

VPN technology establishes an encrypted tunnel between a traveling user's computer and a VPN concentrator on a corporate network over an untrusted network, such as the Internet. Any data transmitted through the encrypted tunnel is secure and is decrypted by the other endpoint device. VPN split tunneling enables user access to corporate resources while still allowing access to Internet resources through the user's Internet connection. Incorrect answer: NAT is incorrect. Network address translation (NAT) is commonly used to enable multiple internal computers to gain public network access using a single public IP address of the NAT public interface. Packet filtering firewall is incorrect. A packet filtering firewall allows or restricts packets based on packet address and protocol information. Proxy server is incorrect. Proxy servers are used to fetch Internet content requested by internal users.

      "explanation": "OBJ 4.1: Validating and sanitizing user input for both search queries and comments is a crucial security technique to prevent SQL injection (SQLi) and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. For SQLi protection, input validation ensures that user-supplied search queries do not include malicious SQL commands that could manipulate the database or expose sensitive information. For XSS protection, sanitization ensures that user-provided comments do not contain malicious scripts that could be executed on other users' browsers, potentially stealing sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions. HTTPS encrypts data during transmission, but it does not protect against attacks that exploit improper handling of user input in the application; therefore, it does not directly address the concerns of SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Implementing a web application firewall (WAF) is a valuable security measure to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing traffic to identify and block potential attacks. However, while a WAF can help in detecting and blocking certain types of attacks, it is not a substitute for proper input validation and sanitization. For support or reporting issues, include"

Industrial machinery is designed to destroy drives thoroughly, leaving no data intact. Degaussing methods expose hard disks to powerful electromagnetics, disrupting data storage patterns. However, not all types of drives, like SSDs and optical media, can be degaussed, limiting its applicability. While shredding can be an effective method, reducing drives or paper to 12mm strips (Level 1) might still leave data recoverable. More thorough shredding or additional measures would be required for complete data destruction. Incineration can be effective, but using municipal incinerators might leave some remnants of the drives, making this method less secure. For support or reporting issues, include"

      "explanation": "OBJ 4.1: AES is currently the most secure and widely adopted encryption protocol for wireless networks. Its strong encryption algorithms and extensive testing demonstrate its effectiveness against various attacks. AES is the recommended choice for ensuring robust security in wireless communication. WEP is an outdated encryption protocol that has been widely exploited and rendered highly insecure. Its weak key management and static keys make it vulnerable to various attacks, and it can be cracked relatively easily. It should be avoided in modern network environments due to its lack of security. While TKIP was an improvement over an older encryption protocol, it is still considered weak and has known vulnerabilities. Due to its security limitations, using TKIP is not advisable, especially when more secure alternatives like AES are available. TKIP is the best choice for devices that are not compatible with AES. Despite being an enhancement over the previous protocol, WPA has some known vulnerabilities, particularly when using its pre-shared key (PSK) mode. Depending solely on WPA might not provide the level of security required to safeguard modern wireless networks. For support or reporting issues, include"

      "correctAnswers": [
        1
      ],
      "explanation": "OBJ: 3.1 - In Industrial Control Systems (ICS), the inability to patch is a significant concern due to several inherent challenges. Many ICS components are designed to be immutable for stability in critical processes, rendering modifications or updates impossible. Additionally, these systems often rely on continuous operation and use proprietary, sometimes legacy, components, making downtime for updates impractical and vendor-dependent patch availability challenging. This inability to apply timely security updates leaves ICS environments vulnerable to known exploits, potentially compromising system integrity, safety, and production. Risk transference refers to the sharing or moving of risk to another party. Having older components in a system may create a need for risk transference, but risk transference is a solution to a security concern that is not as much of a factor as an Inability to Patch. Ease of Deployment refers to how easy it is to install and implement a system, which may affect older components, but is not a security concern. Ease of Recovery considers how easily a system can be put back online after failure.

      "explanation": "OBJ: 2.4 - A SQL injection is a type of injection attack wherein an attacker introduces malicious SQL statements into an input field, aiming to run arbitrary commands on a database. Characters like '=', '%20', and 'OR' are frequently seen in these attacks. If the input is not adequately sanitized, this can lead to unauthorized access to or manipulation of data. Parameter tampering involves altering parameters to manipulate the application's data processing. Though it involves modifying data input, it doesn't align with the observed malicious database queries indicative of SQL injections. Cross-site scripting attacks involve embedding malicious scripts in web pages, which are later executed by unsuspecting users. While it involves injecting malicious code, the objective and behavior of XSS differ significantly from direct database attacks like SQL injections. Buffer overflow attacks happen when data exceeds the buffer's capacity, causing it to overflow into adjacent buffers, thereby corrupting or overwriting the valid data they contain. It's about excess data, not necessarily the content of the data, making it distinct from injection attacks. For support or reporting issues, include"

In this type of attack, a victim is tricked into performing unwanted actions on a web application in which they're authenticated, without the victim necessarily having to click a link. The attacker sends an HTTP request to the victim's browser, spoofing an action on the target site, such as changing account settings. Session hijacking involves taking over a user's session, typically by obtaining their session cookie. While it can result in unauthorized changes, it doesn't typically involve the victim being on an external site before the unexpected change. A session token prediction attack focuses on identifying potential weaknesses in the generation of session tokens. If an attacker can predict the session token, they can take over a session. This type of attack is more about guessing session values rather than inducing unintended changes on behalf of authenticated users.

When used with a RADIUS based authentication server it provides authentication services, checking user credentials to ensure that the user is a legitimate part of the organization and granting access to only those areas of the system that the user is allowed to access. An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors network traffic for malicious activities. It alerts to the potential activity but does not prevent it from passing through the network. In this way, it provides a layer of protection without slowing down network performance. Fail-open refers to what happens when a network encounters errors and exceptions. Fail-open means that when errors occur or exceptions are encountered, the system continues allowing access rather than denying access. Fail-open allows a website to continue offering services even after an error has occurred. The emphasis is, therefore, keeping the website up while the error is addressed, hoping that the error is a minor issue. Fail-close refers to what happens when a network encounters errors and exceptions. Fail-close means that when errors occur or exceptions are encountered, the system denies further access. This prevents any further network traffic until the error or exception are dealt with.

This matches the technique being used in the scenario. Key stretching is a method used that repeatedly hashing the password to make it more random and longer than it originally appeared. This should make the key more time consuming to break. It doesn't necessarily add data to the input, but it can. The key difference between key stretching and regular hashing or salting is the number of times the hashing is done. Hashing is the process of converting an input of any length into a fixed size string of text, using a mathematical function. Hashing doesn't add data to the input before completing the conversion. Digital signatures are a type of electronic signature that uses a specific type of encryption to ensure the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document.

Though adding robustness to the authentication process by requiring users to provide multiple pieces of evidence to access financial data, this method doesn't directly address the regulatory needs of AML/KYC.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: The ALE is less than the cost of mitigating the risk is correct. ALE (annual loss expectancy) is a dollar figure derived from the SLE (single loss expectancy) and the ARO (annual rate of occurrence). For example, the probability of an e-mail server being down for four hours a year might be 65 percent, at a loss of $900, due to the unavailability of that e-mail server for four hours. ALE = ARO × SLE = 65% × $900; therefore, the ALE value would be $585. So, for example, paying $700 annually to protect against a $585 ALE value cannot be justified. Incorrect answers: The ALE is more than the cost of mitigating the risk is incorrect. If the ALE is more than the cost of mitigating the risk, mitigating the risk would be considered acceptable, because mitigating the risk would cost the business less money than having the risk materialize. The SLE is less than the cost of mitigating the risk and The ARO is less than the cost of mitigating the risk are incorrect.

Incorrect Answers: Integer overflow is incorrect. Integer overflows result from mathematical calculations resulting in numbers larger than the integer variable used to hold that value. Pointer dereference is incorrect. Dereferenced pointers contain a null value instead of valid data, which can result in an application crash. DLL injection is incorrect. DLL injection attacks replace valid dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) with malicious variants. Function calls to the malicious DLLs can then compromise a system."

This phase involves gathering data from publicly available sources, such as WHOIS databases, social media platforms, and websites, without alerting the target about the potential upcoming attack. Passive reconnaissance aims to understand the target's environment and identify potential vulnerabilities or areas of interest for the subsequent stages of the test. Known environment involves testers having prior knowledge of the target environment, like network diagrams and IP addresses. While it offers context about the assessment boundaries, it isn't focused on the initial method of silently gathering data about the target. Active reconnaissance is a form of direct engagement with the target system, like port scanning. Such active interactions can be detected by the target system. It's the opposite of passive techniques where no direct engagement with the target is made, thus not fitting the query about methods that avoid direct interaction. The 'defensive' approach in cybersecurity typically refers to the strategies and activities of Blue Teams. These teams focus on implementing and maintaining security measures to protect against cyber threats, monitoring networks for signs of breaches, and responding to any detected incidents.

It is software that is installed on a system or device to detect and prevent unauthorized actions like file modifications and registry changes. Because it can detect and prevent attempts to write data, it can detect and prevent a buffer overflow attack. Removal of unnecessary software is a hardening technique that can help reduce the attack surface of systems and devices by removing unused or unneeded. The more software that is on a system, the more exposure there is to vulnerabilities. If the software is not needed or used, there is no purpose in having extra exposure to vulnerabilities. This will not prevent a buffer overflow attack Disabling ports and protocols is a hardening technique that can help reduce exposure to potential attacks. This can be done on firewalls, switches, routers, and hosts to close or block any network ports or protocols that aren't needed for the normal operation of the systems and devices. Ports are numerical identifiers that specify the destination or source of network traffic, and protocols are rules or standards that define how network traffic is formatted or transmitted.

This is done by changing the default or factory-set passwords that may be easily cracked by automated tools or dictionaries because they are often reused or drawn from a small pool of passwords. Password managers, password generators, and security policies can be used to create and enforce the use of strong and unique passwords for each system and device. Installation of endpoint protection includes installing antivirus, anti-malware, and firewall software on systems or devices. This software helps protect systems and devices from known vulnerabilities. It may detect attempts to crack passwords, but changing the default passwords of devices is more effective in preventing dictionary attacks. Device isolation is a mitigation technique that can help prevent malware from spreading from one system or process to another by limiting their interaction and communication.

A security checkpoint controls and monitors the access of individuals and vehicles into a secure area, it primarily functions as a screening point rather than a physical barrier. Security checkpoints might manage vehicle flow but do not necessarily stop a determined vehicle from breaching a perimeter if not combined with physical barriers. Wire fencing is used to delineate boundaries and can restrict pedestrian and smaller vehicles, however it is not strong enough to stop vehicles effectively, especially if the vehicle is determined to breach the perimeter. Intrusion Detection Systems primarily focus on detecting unauthorized entries or breaches within a building or area using sensors and alarms.

      "explanation": "OBJ: 2.5 - Least privilege is a mitigation technique that limits users to the level of access and privilege they need to do their work. This can limit the extent of an attack by limiting the attacker's access and privilege to those of the compromised user. Least privilege involves applying predefined rules and permissions, such as roles, groups, and functions and enforcing the rules and permissions through mechanisms such as passwords, tokens, and biometrics. Using least privilege, employees will have access to the patient data they need, but not to the data of other patients. Monitoring is a mitigation technique that can help detect and respond to potential threats or incidents on a network. By collecting and analyzing data about the activities and events on the network, security analysts can develop theories about the vulnerabilities and incidents that occur on the system. Monitoring involves using tools and techniques such as logs, alerts, and audits. Monitoring will allow you to know if the data is breached, but monitoring will not prevent unauthorized people from seeing patient data. An application allow list is a mitigation technique that can help enforce compliance with security standards and policies on a system or network. It does this by comparing applications to a list of applications that are allowed to run. These applications have been verified and authorized by the system or network administrator. Any application that is not on the list is not allowed to run. Limiting the applications that employees can use will not prevent them from seeing patient data. Isolation is a mitigation technique that can help prevent malware from spreading from one system or process to another by limiting their interaction and communication. Isolation involves sandboxing or simply disconnecting an infected system. This prevents potentially malicious programs or scripts from accessing the rest of the system or network.

      "explanation": "Correct answers: Place the wireless router in the center of the building and Disable DHCP on the wireless router are correct. Placing the wireless router in the center of the building reduces the signal strength outside of the building. Disabling DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) means connecting clients must manually configure an appropriate IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server. Incorrect answers: Set the SSID to “Floor 1.” is incorrect. SSID broadcasting should be disabled, not set to something that implies a physical location. Disable DNS on the wireless router is incorrect. Disabling DNS is not normally done to harden a wireless network. If it is disabled, wireless clients must simply point to a different DNS server."

The token and the data it substitutes are stored in a secure database. If the original data is needed, it can be accessed using the token and querying the database. The token will be a different size and have a different structure than the original data so the token can't be used to decipher the original data. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. It doesn't use a database Data masking is a method to de-identify some or all characters in a sequence, but not changing the total number of characters that a field should contain. The masked version will be structurally the same, but the data will be hidden. Changing the letters or numbers entered into a password field with dots is an example of data masking. Data that is masked will have the same number of characters as the original data, not a smaller set. Encryption is the process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. It often uses an algorithm to replace the original data with other data.

Outdated software may have unpatched vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of the system or the network. Default credentials are usernames and passwords that are set by default for certain devices or applications. Default credentials can be easily guessed by attackers and used to gain access to the system or the network. Open service ports are ports that are listening for incoming connections from other systems or devices. Open service ports can expose services that may have vulnerabilities or allow unauthorized access to the system. Unsecure networks are networks that do not have adequate security measures, such as encryption, authentication, or firewall, to protect the data transmitted over them.

Another technique is to use data loss prevention (DLP) solutions, which would block leaking information through USB drives and e-mail. Incorrect answers: Enable a host-based firewall is incorrect. Enabling a firewall on the system will not stop copying files to a local USB drive or sending a file through e-mail, which are common techniques used to copy data. Disable wireless networking is incorrect. Wireless networking is not a factor for using data exfiltration techniques, such as copying files to a USB drive or sending files through e-mail (that is, if there is a wired connection).

Tokenization is when sensitive data is stored with a token service instead of with the application data with which the sensitive data is used. The token service creates a random string that maps to the credit card number in the token database. The application then uses the random string to represent the credit card number. Incorrect answers: Hashing is incorrect. Hashing is used to ensure data integrity, not confidentiality. Masking is incorrect. Masking is when the application covers up the data onscreen with a character such as an asterisk (*), but the actual data is still stored in the database in plain text.

      "explanation": "Correct answers: VPN, TLS, and IPSec are correct. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) servers transmit data (including credentials) in clear text. Remote user access to the FTP servers would be secured through a VPN (virtual private network). Some FTP servers support TLS to encrypt FTP packets. IPSec can be used to secure any type of IP traffic, including FTP. IPsec tunnel mode is used to create a secured tunnel between two endpoints. IPsec transport mode is normally used between communicating stations where all data above the IP header is encrypted and replaced with an encapsulation security payload (ESP) header. The authentication header (AH) doesn't encrypt data but is used to verify the integrity of the transmission. Incorrect answer: TPM is incorrect. TPM has nothing to do with securing data transmissions; it refers to hard disk encryption."
